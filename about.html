      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        StorageManager is the go to web application that allows you to keep track any type of item along with a description,
        price, and even an image of the item! The application is easy to use and minimal from unnescesary distractions.
        With its ease of use, StorageManager brings several significant benefits to businesses.
        <br>
        <br>
        StorageManager enhances organization and accessibility of inventory data. By having a centralized system that allows you 
        to update pertinent information about the inventory, it streamlines the ability to keep track of and go through items in stock.
        The inclusion of item images aids in the identification and recognition of items in the inventory. This allows users to
        easily and accurately identify item which can potentially minimize confusion regarding name and descriptions.
